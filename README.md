## Overview
This repository contains an Excel-based project designed to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for analyzing bike sales data. Through data cleaning, the use of pivot tables, and effective data visualizations, this dashboard enables users to explore insights related to various demographic factors influencing bike purchases.

## Dataset
**Source:** [Bike Buyers 1000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/bike-buyers)

The dataset provides information on customers, their demographics, and whether they purchased a bike.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Identify and remove duplicates  
   - Standardize categorical fields (e.g., marital status, gender)  
   
2. **Working Sheet Creation:**  
   - Copy the raw data into a separate working sheet  
   - Perform all transformations on this working copy, leaving the original data intact

3. **Pivot Tables:**  
   - Utilize pivot tables to summarize and analyze key metrics  
   - Uncover patterns and relationships between demographics and bike purchases

4. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Create charts and graphs using recommended chart types  
   - Represent insights such as average income, commute distances, and age-based brackets

5. **Dashboard Assembly:**  
   - Combine all visualizations onto a single dashboard sheet  
   - Provide a user-friendly, interactive experience for data exploration

6. **Chart Customization:**  
   - Update titles, axis labels, and formatting for improved readability  
   - Ensure that charts are accessible and easily interpretable

## Dashboard Components
- **Average Income by Gender and Bike Purchase:**  
  Discover how gender correlates with average income and the likelihood of bike purchasing.

- **Customer Commute Distance:**  
  Analyze how far customers commute and see if this influences their decision to buy a bike.

- **Customer Age Brackets:**  
  Assess bike sales across different age groups (adolescents, middle-aged, and older adults) to understand how age affects purchasing patterns.
